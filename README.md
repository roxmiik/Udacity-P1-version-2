Udacity Front-End Web Developer Project 1 - Build a Portfolio Site

You will be provided a design mockup as a PDF-file and must replicate that design in HTML and CSS. You will develop a responsive website that will display images, descriptions and links to each of the portfolio projects you will complete through the course of the Front-End Web Developer nanodegree.
